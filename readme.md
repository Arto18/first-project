# Markdown cheat sheet  

## Text selection  

To highlight text in markdown use the caracters `_` or `*`.  
Exemple:  
_cursive_, *bold*, _*both*_  

## Headlines

Headers can be created using the `#` symbol. The larger the `#`,
the smaller the header. For example:

# First level header
## Second level header
### Third level header

## Code selection

To highlight the text as code, put it in triple quotes `````.

```
mkdir my_project
cd my_project
git init
```
These are just some of the features of markdown.
